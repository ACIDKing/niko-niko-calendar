## Simple Niko-Niko calendar

![](https://www.agilealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Niko-NikoCalendar.png)

Here are the minimum requirements. You don't have to do anymore but feel free to add what you like. **How you accomplish the basic requirements is the most important part.**

1. Just three emotions (whichever you like)
2. No user management, no initial data. Whoever opens the app should start on a clean calendar and be able to add users and their feedback however they like. (E.g. I go there enter your name, Alex, Steffi, Rinu and Jan for my team and then assign their feedback to the individual days.)
3. You can limit the calendar to February 2019, no need to add a fully fledged calendar.
4. Use React.js, you can import whatever you like (apart from a complete solution ðŸ˜‰).
5. If there should be a backend part to your application (not required, can run standalone in the browser) you can use whatever you like.
6. This is more about functionality than looks.have to write tests for everything but seeing a few example tests would be good.

And a few requirements towards the process:

1. Commit often and with useful commit messages. I'd like to see the program evolving and how you got started.
2. If you made any sketches first feels free to upload them.
3. Include a README explaining how to build, run, and test the application.



Iâ€™m not looking to be astonished by the result, I simply want to see that you understand your craft. Iâ€™ll take the time youâ€™ve spend into consideration, so if you donâ€™t have much time right now just let me know and limit your work on this task accordingly. If there are features missing or known bugs just let me know too.
